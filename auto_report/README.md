```plaintext
input_data_folder
├── easylabel.zip
│   ├── images
│   │   ├── image_1.png
│   │   ├── ...
│   │   ├── image_n.png
│   └── images.json
└── settings.json
```

- `easylabel.zip`: EasyLabel output with all labeled images (could have any name). This file must have:
    - `images`: Store all pre-processed images from EasyLabel.
    - `images.json`: Generated by EasyLabel with image labels.
- `settings.json`: Tri-Chile specific data for report generation.

For being more precise. The image folder and the images.json are provided from EasyLabel software as an ouput.

If you take the GitHub repo as the root, to generate a report you only need to execute the following terminal command:

```bash	
auto_report/make_report.sh $DATA_INPUT_DIR $PDF_EXPORT_DIR $$PDF_CONFIG

```bash	
auto_report/make_report.sh auto_report/test/input auto_report/test/output a
```
