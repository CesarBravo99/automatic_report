For being more precise. The image folder and the images.json are provided from EasyLabel software as an ouput.

If you take the GitHub repo as the root, to generate a report you only need to execute the following terminal command:

```bash	
auto_report/make_report.sh $DATA_INPUT_DIR $PDF_EXPORT_DIR $$PDF_CONFIG
