#### EasyLabel Workflow

- **Upload Images:** Navigate to the website and upload images for tagging. Images must pass a quality check for non-repetition and clarity.
- **Label Images:** Individually label each image, specifying spatial location, observations, and mark type.
- **Download Labeled Images:** Export all labeled images in .zip format.

After downloading the .zip file, upload it to the designated form for further processing.
